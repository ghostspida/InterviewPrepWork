# Given an array of unsorted numbers and a target number, find a triplet in the array whose sum is as close to the target number as possible, return the sum of the triplet
# If there are more than one such triplet, return the sum of the triplet with the smallest sum

# INPUTS/OUPUTS
# [-2, 0, 1, 2], target = 2 => 1
# explanation:
#   the triplet [-2, 1, 2] has the closest sum to the target
